## Day 1 of my Cloud Practitioner Certification
###### Today, I learned about the different types of cloud deployment models and cloud services. I was also introduced to the advantages of moving servers to the cloud from on-premise data centers.

### Types of Cloud Services
* Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS)
  * Customer has full control over the server.
  * Ex: EC2, VM, Lightsail
* Platform as a Service (PAAS)
  * Customer cannot access the VM nor OS but can deploy applications.
  * AWS handles OS patches and updates.
  * Ex: AWS RDS, Elastic Beanstalk, DynamoDB, Docuement DB
* Software as a Service (SAAS)
  * Customer has NO control over the server and CANNOT deploy code to the server.
  * Customer can ONLY use the service
  * Ex: GMAIL, Office 365, Drive, Salesforce

### Cloud Deployment Models
* Private Cloud
  * Utilizing cloud technologies such as VMs but on-premise.
* Public Cloud
  * Cloud services provided by AWS, Azure, Google, etc.
  * Not on-premise.
* Hybrid Cloud
  * A mix of private and public cloud
  * Best of both worlds
  * Maximum flexibiliy 
* Multi Cloud
  * Using multiple different public cloud providers at once.
  * Ex: Using AWS and Azure.
* Community Cloud
  * Specific to government and China

### Advantages of moving to Cloud from On-Premise
* **Agility** is the ability to respond to change rapidly based on changes to market or environment, ensuring fast time to market
* **Elasticity** is the ability to automatically or dynamically increase or decrease resources as needed
* **Fault tolerance** is the ability to remain up and running even in the event of a component (or service) no longer functioning
* **High availability (HA)** is the ability of a system to operate continuously without failing for a designated period of time
* **Going global in minutes** is the ability to spin of services in any region
* **Pay-as-you-go** - metered billing (Capex is replaced with Opex)
* **Economies of scale** is the ability to reduce costs and gain efficiency when operating at a larger scale
* No need to manage data centers such as physical security, cooling, power, etc.
