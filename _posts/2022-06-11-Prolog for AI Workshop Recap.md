## Logical Programming in Prolog for AI Workshop Recap:

---

This past week, I attended the "Logical Programming in Prolog for AI Workshop" hosted by Dr. Gopal Gupta at UTD. In this workshop, I learned in detail about one of the less talked about fields in artifical intelligience, automated reasoning. 
Automated reasoning can best be explained as the common sense that we as humans inherently possess that machines do not. Additionally, automated reasoning is what many CS experts are saying is what is going to revolutionize the machine learning field as it will allow for decision making processes instead of the pure computations of traditional machine learning.
Prolog is the best language to attempt to complete this task as it is the most used logical programming language that is comprised of user declared relations and rules.


at first was frustrating cuz didnt have loopos so only recursion which to me was very un-intuitive in general and even worse in prolog but by the end, I can confidently state that the numerous excersizes we completed as a class has tremendously improved my problem solving skills with respect to recursion.
